I'm a postdoc at the Learning and Intelligence Systems Lab working with [Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de//mtoussai//). I'm affiliated with Uni Stuttgart & Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and working within the [Cluster of Excellence: IntCDC](https://www.intcdc.uni-stuttgart.de/). 

My research interests include task and motion planning in robotics, and learning and reasoning for intelligent systems. I received my PhD degree from [TU Munich](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lsr/home/), where I focused on HRI in close-proximity scenarios. I studied computer science at [UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [Ko√ß Uni](https://rml.ku.edu.tr/), and started my research journey working on haptic interfaces.
